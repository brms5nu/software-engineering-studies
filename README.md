## λ Functional Programming
Concepts, exercises, and real-world implementations using Clojure.

> **Getting started →** [`functional-programming/clojure/`](functional-programming/clojure/) — Clojure CLI (`deps.edn`) project with a REPL-ready starter namespace. Run `clj` from that directory to launch a REPL.

- [ ] Basic syntax and explorations.
- [ ] REPL-driven development best practices.
- [ ] Transducers and advanced concurrency.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Systems Design
Deep dives into how complex systems work.
- Diplomat architecture concepts.
- Microservices patterns.
- Data consistency in distributed systems.

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
Studies on how AI is transforming software engineering.
- Prompt Engineering for developers.
- LLM integrations and AI agents.
