# The Pragmatic Programmer

*By Andrew Hunt & David Thomas*

This book will help you turn into a better programmer. It brings us several tips for improvement.

I will write some comments about each tip, in a form of dev to dev.

Here we go:</br>

> Tip 1: Care About Your Craft.

</br>
There is so much stuff we have to do and know if the goal is to be out of the box. There are different technologies, software engineering concepts, analysis requirements, architecture solution studies for the product... for the business... AI tools, documentation, tests, communication skills, teamwork etc.

This tip can be a trigger to make a dev look for improvements. A carpenter doesn't just know how to hammer, they understand wood, joints, finishes, design. And it's not just about learning, but taking ownership of quality.

When you care about your craft, you become the driver of your own growth.

A point of attention here: "Pragmatic Programmer" also means looking for efficiency, that is, knowing when to dive in and when to stay on the surface -> ***balance***.

None of the other tips matter if you don't genuinely care.</br> 

> Tip 2: Think about your job.
